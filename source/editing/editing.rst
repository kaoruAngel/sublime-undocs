Overview
========

Sublime Text is brim-full of editing features. This topic just
scratches the surface of what's possible.

Multiple Selections
===================

Multiple selections let you make sweeping changes to your text efficiently.
Any praise about multiple selections is an understatement. This is why:

Select some text and press ``Ctrl + D`` to **add more** instances. If
you want **to skip the current instance**, press ``Ctrl + K, Ctrl + D``.

If you go too far, press ``Ctrl + U`` to **deselect** the current instance.


Transforming Multiple Selections into Lines
===========================================

``Ctrl + L`` expands the selections to the end of the line. ``Ctrl + Shift + L``
splits the selections into lines.

You can copy multiple selected lines to a separate buffer, edit them there,
select the content again as multiple lines and then paste them back into
place in the first buffer.


Column Selection
================

You can select a rectangular area of a file. Column selection makes use of
multiple selections.

It's possible to add blocks of text to or remove them from the selection.

The **Edit**, **Selection**, **Find** and **Goto** menus are good places to
look for handy editing tools. You might end up using just a few of them,
but the rest will still be there for when you need them.
